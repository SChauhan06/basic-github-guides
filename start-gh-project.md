**Starting a GitHub Project**

1. **Create a repo.**

A repository, or repo, is where your project and all related files will reside. Think of it as project-specific folder where you can store code, datasets, images and other files you may need. When working with GitHub it&#39;s important to distinguish b/w a _local_ repo and a _remote_ (or hosted) repo. The first refers to a repo stored on your computer. The second refers to a repo stored in a cloud-based code hosting service such as GitHub â€“ all repos created within GitHub are remote repos. If you plan to collaborate with others using GitHub, then you must first create a remote repo. To create a remote repo, go to your GitHub account and click on the &#39;Repositories&#39; button and then the &#39;New&#39; button.

Tip: You can also add an existing local repo to GitHub; see steps 8 and 9 from [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line) link.

2. **Clone the repo.**

If you&#39;re project doesn&#39;t already exist on your computer, then you&#39;ll have to clone it from GitHub. To clone a repo, find the &quot;SSH clone URL&quot; under the &#39;Code&#39; button in your GitHub repo of interest. The repo can be cloned by typing `git clone ssh_clone_url` within your local directory of choice.
